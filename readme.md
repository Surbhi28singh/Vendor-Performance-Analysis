## 📖 About the Project

In today's data-driven world, understanding customer behavior isn't just a luxury — it's a necessity. This project dives into an e-commerce dataset to uncover **what customers are buying**, **how they feel about it**, and **what businesses can do next**.

Using a blend of **Python**, **SQL**, and **Power BI**, I created a complete analytics pipeline that cleans, transforms, analyzes, and visualizes data — giving stakeholders exactly what they need to make informed decisions.
